https://github.com/paulmg/ThreeJS-Webpack-ES6-Boilerplate

## Frameworks
- threejs
- npm
*considerations*
- https://github.com/regl-project/regl
- https://cocoon.io/
- pixijs for 2d rendering (this could be the best thing for 2d component building)

### Reference material

#### Considerations
I am attempting to build the whole application using the canvas and as little of the dom as possible this is not a react project!...Or it isn't yet :p
Can canvas be wrapped in svg? If that's possible then canvas can be embedded into components that adhere to webpage grid layout principles
